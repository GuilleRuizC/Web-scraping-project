About Us*
Today, 1 in 3 Americans say they suffer from mental health problems like anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Despite this mental health epidemic, seeing a psychiatrist can take up to 3 months and cost as much as $500.

Shocked? Us too. That's why we started Cerebral, a telemedicine-first mental health startup. We are breaking down the barriers to access to mental healthcare so that anybody can get the care and meds they need immediately and for just $99/month. We launched publicly in January 2020 and are growing at over 40% month-over-month, and need your help.
About the Role*
We are seeking a board-certified Psychiatrist to practice on the Cerebral telemedicine platform. Medical school or residency at a US medical center is required. Our patient-base is a diverse population with a mix of private, public, and uninsured patients. Our typical clinical scope includes anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and insomnia.

Cerebral physicians operate within an interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists, primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, therapists, and Care Counselors to provide high-level patient care.

In Brooklyn, NY for 59 years, Nazareth is a Catholic, college preparatory high school sponsored by the Xaverian Brothers.

Nazareth prides itself in maintaining a 98-100% graduation rate annually, and 98% of its students attend college.

As a Xaverian Brothers Sponsored School (XBSS), Nazareth is part of a proud and distinguished legacy of educational excellence. Faithful to the traditions of the Xaverian Brothers, the community takes particular pride in the enduring personal relationships which are at the heart of defining the school’s culture. The faculty and staff are committed to supporting every student that graces the school’s hallways, academically, spiritually, emotionally, athletically and socially. Nazareth is a second home for students, so much so that many students remain in the building well into the evening for continued academic support, spiritual enrichment, continued comradery, athletic activities and extra-curricular involvement.

Enrollment is up over 30% in the past five years, the school participates in a 1 to 1 initiative where every student receives a laptop, and a new 3-D Virtual Lab and a new science lab have been created in recent years.

Today, 1 in 3 Americans say they suffer from mental health problems like anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Despite this mental health epidemic, seeing a psychiatrist can take up to 3 months and cost as much as $500.

Shocked? Us too. That's why we started Cerebral, a telemedicine-first mental health startup. We are breaking down the barriers to access to mental healthcare so that anybody can get the care and meds they need immediately and for just $99/month. We launched publicly in January 2020 and are growing at over 40% month-over-month, and need your help.
About the Role*
We are seeking a board-certified Psychiatrist to practice on the Cerebral telemedicine platform. Medical school or residency at a US medical center is required. Our patient-base is a diverse population with a mix of private, public, and uninsured patients. Our typical clinical scope includes anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and insomnia.

Cerebral physicians operate within an interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists, primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, therapists, and Care Counselors to provide high-level patient care. We believe that our collaborative-care model, and telemedicine platform will be revolutionary in improving access to care to those struggling with mental health issues.

Cerebral physicians operate within an interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists, primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, therapists, and Care Counselors to provide high-level patient care. We believe that our collaborative-care model, and telemedicine platform will be revolutionary in improving access to care to those struggling with mental health issues. Cerebral providers see patients from the convenience of their own home or office.

About Us*
Today, 1 in 3 Americans say they suffer from mental health problems like anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Despite this mental health epidemic, seeing a psychiatrist can take up to 3 months and cost as much as $500.

Shocked? Us too. That's why we started Cerebral, a telemedicine-first mental health startup. We are breaking down the barriers to access to mental healthcare so that anybody can get the care and meds they need immediately and for just $99/month.

Cerebral physicians operate within an interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists, primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, therapists, and Care Counselors to provide high-level patient care. We believe that our collaborative-care model, and telemedicine platform will be revolutionary in improving access to care to those struggling with mental health issues. Cerebral providers see patients from the convenience of their own home or office.
We are seeking candidates who are able to work at least 10-12 hours per week, have licenses in at least 5 states, and are comfortable supervising Cerebral Nurse Practitioners.*
